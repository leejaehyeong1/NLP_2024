Did he expect to see Voldemort staring out of them, afraid, perhaps, that their vivid green might turn suddenly to scarlet, with catlike slits for pupils? Harry remembered how the snakelike face of Voldemort had once forced itself out of the back of Professor Quirrell's head and ran his hand over the back of his own, wondering what it would feel like if Voldemort burst out of his skull.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He felt dirty, contaminated, as though he were carrying some deadly germ, unworthy to sit on the Underground train back from the hospital with innocent, clean people whose minds and bodies were free of the taint of Voldemort . . . he had not merely seen the snake, he had been the snake, he knew it now . . .\\u00a0 \\u00a0 A truly terrible thought then occurred to him, a memory bobbing to the surface of his mind, one that made his insides writhe and squirm like serpents.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 What's he after, apart from followers?\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Stuff he can only get by stealth . . . like a weapon. Something he didn't have last time.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 I'm the weapon, Harry thought, and it was as though poison were pumping through his veins, chilling him, bringing him out in a sweat as he swayed with the train through the dark tunnel. I'm the one Voldemort's trying to use, that's why they've got guards around me everywhere I go, it's not for my protection, it's for other people's, only it's not working, they can't have someone on me all the time at Hogwarts . . . I did attack Mr Weasley last night, it was me. Voldemort made me do it and he could be inside me, listening to my thoughts right now - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Are you all right, Harry, dear?' whispered Mrs Weasley, leaning across Ginny to speak to him as the train rattled along through its dark tunnel. 'You don't look very well. Are you feeling sick?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 They were all watching him. He shook his head violently and stared up at an advertisement for home insurance.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Harry, dear, are you sure you're all right?' said Mrs Weasley in a worried voice, as they walked around the unkempt patch of grass in the middle of Grimmauld Place. 'You look ever so pale . . . are you sure you slept this morning? You go upstairs to bed right now and you can have a couple of hours of sleep before dinner, all right?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He nodded; here was a ready-made excuse not to talk to any of the others, which was precisely what he wanted, so when she opened the front door he hurried straight past the trolls-leg umbrella stand, up the stairs and into his and Ron's bedroom.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Here, he began to pace up and down, past the two beds and Phineas Nigellus's empty picture frame, his brain teeming and seething with questions and ever more dreadful ideas.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 How had he become a snake? Perhaps he was an Animagus . . . no, he couldn't be, he would know . . . perhaps Voldemort was an Animagus . . . yes, thought Harry, that would fit, he would turn into a snake of course . . . and when he's possessing me, then we both transform . . . that still doesn't explain how I got to London and back to my bed in the space of about five minutes . . . but then Voldemort's about the most powerful wizard in the world, apart from Dumbledore, it's probably no problem at all to him to transport people like that.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 And then, with a terrible stab of panic, he thought, but this is insane - if Voldemort's possessing me, I'm giving him a clear view into the Headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix right now! He'll know who's in the Order and where Sirius is . . . and I've heard loads of stuff I shouldn't have, everything Sirius told me the first night I was here . . .\\u00a0 \\u00a0 There was only one thing for it: he would have to leave Grimmauld Place straightaway. He would spend Christmas at Hogwarts without the others, which would keep them sate over the holidays at least . . . but no, that wouldn't do, there were still plenty of people at Hogwarts to maim and injure. What if it was Seamus, Dean or Neville next time? He stopped his pacing and stood staring at Phineas Nigellus's empty frame. A leaden sensation was settling in the pit of his stomach. He had no alternative: he was going to have to return to Privet Drive, cut himself off from other wizards entirely.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Well, if he had to do it, he thought, there was no point hanging around. Trying with all his might not to think how the Dursleys were going to react when they found him on their doorstep six months earlier than they had expected, he strode over to his trunk, slammed the lid shut and locked it, then glanced around automatically for Hedwig before remembering that she was still at Hogwarts - well, her cage would be one less thing to carry - he seized one end of his trunk and had dragged it halfway towards the door when a snide voice said, 'Running away, are we?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He looked around. Phineas Nigellus had appeared on the canvas of his portrait and was leaning against the frame, watching Harry with an amused expression on his face.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Not running away, no,' said Harry shortly, dragging his trunk a few more feet across the room.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I thought,' said Phineas Nigellus, stroking his pointed beard, 'that to belong in Gryffindor house you were supposed to be brave? It looks to me as though you would have been better off in my own house. We Slytherins are brave, yes, but not stupid. For instance, given the choice, we will always choose to save our own necks.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'It's not my own neck I'm saving,' said Harry tersely, tugging the trunk over a patch of particularly uneven, moth-eaten carpet right in front of the door.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Oh, I see,' said Phineas Nigellus, still stroking his beard, 'this is no cowardly flight - you are being noble.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry ignored him. His hand was on the doorknob when Phineas Nigellus said lazily, 'I have a message for you from Albus Dumbledore.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry span round.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'What is it?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 ' \\\\Stay where you are.\\\\\\\" '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I haven't moved!' said Harry, his hand still upon the doorknob. 'So what's the message?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I have just given it to you, dolt,' said Phineas Nigellus smoothly. 'Dumbledore says, \\\\\\\"Stay where you are.\\\\\\\" '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Why?' said Harry eagerly, dropping the end of his trunk. 'Why does he want me to stay? What else did he say?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Nothing whatsoever,' said Phineas Nigellus, raising a thin black eyebrow as though he found Harry impertinent.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry's temper rose to the surface like a snake rearing from long grass. He was exhausted, he was confused beyond measure, he had experienced terror, relief, then terror again in the last twelve hours, and still Dumbledore did not want to talk to him!\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'So that's it, is it?' he said loudly. ' \\\\\\\"Stay where you are\\\\\\\"? That's all anyone could tell me after I got attacked by those Dementors, loo! Just stay put while the grown-ups sort it out, Harry! We won't bother telling you anything, though, because your tiny little brain might not be able to cope with it!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'You know,' said Phineas Nigellus, even more loudly than Harry, 'this is precisely why I loathed being a teacher! Young people are so infernally convinced that they are absolutely right about everything. Has it not occurred to you, my poor puffed-up popinjay, that there might be an excellent reason why the Headmaster of Hogwarts is not confiding every tiny detail of his plans to you? Have you never paused, while feeling hard-done-by, to note that following Dumbledore's orders has never yet led you into harm? No. No, like all young people, you are quite sure that you alone feel and think, you alone recognise danger, you alone are the only one clever enough to realise what the Dark Lord may be planning - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'He is planning something to do with me, then?' said Harry swiftly.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Did I say that?' said Phineas Nigellus, idly examining his silk gloves. 'Now, if you will excuse me, I have better things to do than listen to adolescent agonising . . . good-day to you.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 And he strolled to the edge of his frame and out of sight.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Fine, go then!' Harry bellowed at the empty frame. 'And tell Dumbledore thanks for nothing!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 The empty canvas remained silent. Fuming, Harry dragged his trunk back to the foot of his bed, then threw himself face down on the moth-eaten covers, his eyes shut, his body heavy and aching.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He felt as though he had journeyed for miles and miles . . . it seemed impossible that less than twenty-four hours ago Cho Chang had been approaching him under the mistletoe . . . he was so tired . . . he was scared to sleep . . . yet he did not know how long he could fight it . . . Dumbledore had told him to stay . . . that must mean he was allowed to sleep . . . but he was scared . . . what if it happened again?\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He was sinking into shadows . . .\\u00a0 \\u00a0 It was as though a film in his head had been waiting to start. He was walking down a deserted corridor towards a plain black door, past rough stone walls, torches, and an open doorway on to a flight of stone steps leading downstairs on the left . . .\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He reached the black door but could not open it. . . he stood gazing at it, desperate for entry . . . something he wanted with all his heart lay beyond . . . a prize beyond his dreams . . . if only his scar would stop prickling . . . then he would be able to think more clearly . . .\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Harry,' said Ron's voice, from far, far away, 'Mum says dinners ready, but she'll save you something if you want to stay in bed.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry opened his eyes, but Ron had already left the room.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He doesn't want to be on his own with me, Harry thought. Not after what he heard Moody say.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He supposed none of them would want him there any more, now that they knew what was inside him.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He would not go down to dinner; he would not inflict his company on them. He turned over on to his other side and, after a while, dropped back off to sleep. He woke much later, in the early hours of the morning, his insides aching with hunger and Ron snoring in the next bed. Squinting around the room, he saw the dark outline of Phineas Nigellus standing again in his portrait and it occurred to Harry that Dumbledore had probably sent Phineas Nigellus to watch over him, in case he attacked somebody else.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 The feeling of being unclean intensified. He half-wished he had not obeyed Dumbledore . . . if this was how life was going to be for him in Grimmauld Place from now on, maybe he would be better off in Privet Drive after all.*Everybody else spent the following morning putting up Christmas decorations. Harry could not remember Sirius ever being in such a good mood; he was actually singing carols, apparently delighted that he was to have company over Christmas. Harry could hear his voice echoing up through the floor in the cold drawing room where he was sitting alone, watching the sky growing whiter outside the windows, threatening snow, all the time feeling a savage pleasure that he was giving the others the opportunity to keep talking about him, as they were bound to be doing. When he heard Mrs Weasley calling his name softly up the stairs around lunchtime, he retreated further upstairs and ignored her.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Around six o'clock in the evening the doorbell rang and Mrs Black started screaming again. Assuming that Mundungus or some other Order member had come to call, Harry merely settled himself more comfortably against the wall of Buckbeak's room where he was hiding, trying to ignore how hungry he felt as he fed dead rats to the Hippogriff. It came as a slight shock when somebody hammered hard on the door a few minutes later.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I know you're in there,' said Hermione's voice. 'Will you please come out? I want to talk to you.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'What are you doing here?' Harry asked her, pulling open the door as Buckbeak resumed his scratching at the straw-strewn floor for any fragments of rat he may have dropped. 'I thought you were skiing with your mum and dad?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well, to tell the truth, skiing's not really my thing,' said Hermione. 'So, I've come here for Christmas.' There was snow in her hair and her face was pink with cold. 'But don t tell Ron. I told him skiing's really good because he kept laughing so much. Mum and Dad are a bit disappointed, but I've told them that everyone who is serious about the exams is staying at Hogwarts to study. They want me to do well, they'll understand. Anyway,' she said briskly, 'let's go to your bedroom, Ron's mum has lit a fire in there and she's sent up sandwiches.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry followed her back to the second floor. When he entered the bedroom, he was rather surprised to see both Ron and Ginny waiting for them, sitting on Ron's bed.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I came on the Knight Bus,' said Hermione airily, pulling off her jacket before Harry had time to speak. 'Dumbledore told me what had happened first thing this morning, but I had to wait for term to end officially before setting off. Umbridge is already livid that you lot disappeared right under her nose, even though Dumbledore told her Mr Weasley was in St Mungo's and he'd given you all permission to visit. So . . .'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 She sat down next to Ginny, and the two girls and Ron all looked up at Harry.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'How're you feeling?' asked Hermione.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Fine,' said Harry stiffly.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Oh, don't lie, Harry,' she said impatiently. 'Ron and Ginny say you've been hiding from everyone since you got back from St Mungo's.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 They do, do they?' said Harry, glaring at Ron and Ginny. Ron looked down at his feet but Ginny seemed quite unabashed.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well, you have!' she said. 'And you won't look at any of us!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'It's you lot who won't look at me!' said Harry angrily.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Maybe you're taking it in turns to look, and keep missing each other,' suggested Hermione, the corners of her mouth twitching.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Very funny,' snapped Harry, turning away.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Oh, stop feeling all misunderstood,' said Hermione sharply. 'Look, the others have told me what you overheard last night on the Extendable Ears - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yeah?' growled Harry, his hands deep in his pockets as he watched the snow now falling thickly outside. 'All been talking about me, have you? Well, I'm getting used to it.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'We wanted to talk to you, Harry' said Ginny, 'but as you've been hiding ever since we got back - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I didn't want anyone to talk to me,' said Harry, who was feeling more and more nettled.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well, that was a bit stupid of you,' said Ginny angrily, 'seeing as you don't know anyone but me who's been possessed by You-Know-Who, and I can tell you how it feels.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry remained quite still as the impact of these words hit him. Then he wheeled round.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I forgot,' he said.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Lucky you,' said Ginny coolly.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Tin sorry,' Harry said, and he meant it. 'So . . . so, do you think I'm being possessed, then?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well, can you remember everything you've been doing?' Ginny asked. 'Are there big blank periods where you don't know what you've been up to?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry racked his brains.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'No,' he said.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Then You-Know-Who hasn't ever possessed you,' said Ginny simply. 'When he did it to me, I couldn't remember what I'd been doing for hours at a time. I'd find myself somewhere and not know how I got there.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry hardly dared believe her, yet his heart was lightening almost in spite of himself.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'That dream I had about your dad and the snake, though - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Harry, you've had these dreams before,' Hermione said. 'You had flashes of what Voldemort was up to last year.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 This was different,' said Harry, shaking his head. T was inside that snake. It was like I was the snake . . . what if Voldemort somehow transported me to London - ?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'One day,' said Hermione, sounding thoroughly exasperated, 'you'll read Hogwarts: A History, and perhaps it will remind you that you can't Apparate or Disapparaie inside Hogwarts. Even Voldemort couldn't just make you fly out of your dormitory, Harry.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'You didn't leave your bed, male,' said Ron. T saw you thrashing around in your sleep for at least a minute before we could wake you up.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry started pacing up and down the room again, thinking. What they were all saying was not only comforting, it made sense . . . without really thinking, he took a sandwich from the plate on the bed and crammed it hungrily into his mouth.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 I'm not the weapon after all, thought Harry. His heart swelled with happiness and relief, and he felt like joining in as they heard\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Sirius tramping past their door towards Buckbeaks room, singing 'God Rest Ye, Merry Hippogriffs' at the top of his voice.*How could he have dreamed of returning to Privet Drive for Christmas? Sirius's delight at having the house full again, and especially at having Harry back, was infectious. He was no longer their sullen host of the summer; now he seemed determined that everyone should enjoy themselves as much, if not more than they would have done at Hogwarts, and he worked tirelessly in the run-up to Christmas Day, cleaning and decorating with their help, so that by the time they all went to bed on Christmas Eve the house was barely recognisable. The tarnished chandeliers were no longer hung with cobwebs but with garlands of holly and gold and silver streamers; magical snow glittered in heaps over the threadbare carpets; a great Christmas tree, obtained by Mundungus and decorated with live fairies, blocked Sirius's family tree from view, and even the stuffed elf-heads on the hall wall wore Father Christmas hats and beards.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry awoke on Christmas morning to find a stack of presents at the foot of his bed and Ron already halfway through opening his own, rather larger, pile.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Good haul this year,' he informed Harry through a cloud of paper. Thanks for the Broom Compass, it's excellent; beats Hermione's - she got me a homework planner - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry sorted through his presents and found one with Hermione's handwriting on it. She had given him, too, a book that resembled a diary except that every time he opened a page it said aloud things like: 'Do it today or later you'll pay!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Sirius and Lupin had given Harry a set of excellent books entitled Practical Defensive Magic and its Use Against the Dark Arts, which had superb, moving colour illustrations of all the counter-jinxes and hexes it described. Harry flicked through the first volume eagerly; he could see it was going to be highly useful in his plans for the DA. Hagrid had sent a furry brown wallet that had fangs, which were presumably supposed to be an anti-theft device, but unfortunately prevented Harry putting any money in without getting his fingers ripped off. Tonks's present was a small, working model of a Firebolt, which Harry watched fly around the room, wishing he still had his full-size version; Ron had given him an enormous box of Every-Flavour Beans, Mr and Mrs Weasley the usual hand-knitted jumper and some mince pies, and Dobby a truly dreadful painting that Harry suspected had been done by the elf himself. He had just turned it upside-down to see whether it looked better that way when, with a loud crack, Fred and George Apparated at the foot of his bed.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Merry Christmas,' said George. 'Don't go downstairs for a bit.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Why not?' said Ron.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Mum's crying again,' said Fred heavily. 'Percy sent back his Christmas jumper.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Without a note,' added George. 'Hasn't asked how Dad is or visited him or anything.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'We tried to comfort her,' said Fred, moving around the bed to look at Harry's portrait. Told her Percy's nothing more than a humungous pile of rat droppings.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Didn't work,' said George, helping himself to a Chocolate Frog. 'So Lupin took over. Best let him cheer her up before we go down for breakfast, I reckon.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'What's that supposed to be, anyway?' asked Fred, squinting at Dobbys painting. 'Looks like a gibbon with two black eyes.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'It's Harry!' said George, pointing at the back of the picture, 'says so on the back!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Good likeness,' said Fred, grinning. Harry threw his new homework diary at him; it hit the wall opposite and fell to the floor where it said happily: 'If you've dotted the \\\\\\\"i\\\\\\\"s and crossed the \\\\\\\"t\\\\\\\"s then you may do whatever you please!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 They got up and dressed. They could hear the various inhabitants of the house calling 'Merry Christmas' to one another. On their way downstairs they met Hermione.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Thanks for the book, Harry,' she said happily. 'I've been wanting that New Theory of Numerology for ages! And that perfume's really unusual, Ron.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'No problem,' said Ron. 'Who's that for, anyway?' he added, nodding at the neatly wrapped present she was carrying.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Kreacher,' said Hermione brightly.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'It had better not be clothes!' Ron warned her. 'You know what Sirius said: Kreacher knows too much, we can't set him free!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'It isn't clothes,' said Hermione, 'although if I had my way I'd certainly give him something to wear other than that filthy old rag. No, it's a patchwork quilt, I thought it would brighten up his bedroom.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'What bedroom?' said Harry, dropping his voice to a whisper as they were passing the portrait of Sirius's mother.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well, Sirius says it's not so much a bedroom, more a kind of - 'den,' said Hermione. 'Apparently he sleeps under the boiler in that cupboard off the kitchen.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Mrs Weasley was the only person in the basement when they arrived there. She was standing at the stove and sounded as though she had a bad head cold as she wished them 'Merry Christmas', and they all averted their eyes.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'So, is this Kreacher's bedroom?' said Ron, strolling over to a dingy door in the corner opposite the pantry. Harry had never seen it open.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yes,' said Hermione, now sounding a little nervous. 'Er . . . I think we'd better knock.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Ron rapped on the door with his knuckles but there was no reply.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'He must be sneaking around upstairs,' he said, and without further ado pulled open the door. 'Urgh!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry peered inside. Most of the cupboard was taken up with a very large and old-fashioned boiler, but in the foot of space underneath the pipes Kreacher had made himself something that looked like a nest. A jumble of assorted rags and smelly old blankets were piled on the floor and the small dent in the middle of it showed where Kreacher curled up to sleep every night. Here and there among the material were stale bread crusts and mouldy old bits of cheese. In a far corner glinted small objects and coins that Harry guessed Kreacher had saved, magpie-like, from Sirius's purge of the house, and he had also managed to retrieve the silver-framed family photographs that Sirius had thrown away over the summer. Their glass might be shattered, but still the little black-and-white people inside them peered up at him haughtily, including - he felt a little jolt in his stomach - the dark, heavy-lidded woman whose trial he had witnessed in Dumbledore's Pensieve: Bellatrix Lestrange. By the looks of it, hers was Kreachers favourite photograph; he had placed it to the fore of all the others and had mended the glass clumsily with Spellotape.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I think I'll just leave his present here,' said Hermione, laying the package neatly in the middle of the depression in the rags and blankets and closing the door quietly. 'He'll find it later, that'll be fine.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Come to think of it,' said Sirius, emerging from the pantry carrying a large turkey as they closed the cupboard door, 'has anyone actually seen Kreacher lately?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I haven't seen him since the night we came back here,' said Harry. 'You were ordering him out of the kitchen.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yeah . . .' said Sirius, frowning. 'You know, I think that's the last time I saw him, too . . . he must be hiding upstairs somewhere.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'He couldn't have left, could he?' said Harry. 'I mean, when you said \\\\\\\"out\\\\\\\", maybe he thought you meant get out of the house?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'No, no, house-elves can't leave unless they're given clothes. They're tied to their family's house,' said Sirius.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 They can leave the house if they really want to,' Harry contradicted him. 'Dobby did, he left the Malfoy's' to give me warnings two years ago. He had to punish himself afterwards, but he still managed it.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Sirius looked slightly disconcerted for a moment, then said, 'I'll look for him later, I expect I'll find him upstairs crying his eyes out over my mother's old bloomers or something. Of course, he might have crawled into the airing cupboard and died . . . but I mustn't get my hopes up.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Fred, George and Ron laughed; Hermione, however, looked reproachful.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Once they had eaten their Christmas lunch, the Weasleys, Harry a:id Hermione were planning to pay Mr Weasley another visit, escorted by Mad-Eye and Lupin. Mundungus turned up in time for Christmas pudding and trifle, having managed to 'borrow' a car for the occasion, as the Underground did not run on Christmas Day. The car, which Harry doubted very much had been taken with the consent of its owner, had been enlarged with a spell like the Weasleys' old Ford Anglia had once been. Although normally proportioned outside, ten people with Mundungus driving were able to fit into it quite comfortably. Mrs Weasley hesitated before getting inside - Harry knew her disapproval of Mundungus was battling with her dislike of travelling without magic - but, finally, the cold outside and her children's pleading triumphed, and she settled herself into the back seat between Fred and Bill with good grace.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 The journey to St Mungo's was quite quick as there was very little traffic on the roads. A small trickle of witches and wizards was creeping furtively up the otherwise deserted street to visit the hospital. Harry and the others got out of the car, and Mundungus drove off around the corner to wait for them. They strolled casually towards the window where the dummy in green nylon stood, then, one by one, stepped through the glass.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 The reception area looked pleasantly festive: the crystal orbs that illuminated St Mungo's had been coloured red and gold to become gigantic, glowing Christmas baubles; holly hung around every doorway; and shining white Christmas trees covered in magical snow and icicles glittered in every corner, each one topped with a gleaming gold star. It was less crowded than the last time they had been there, although halfway across the room Harry found himself shunted aside by a witch with a satsuma jammed up her left nostril.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Family argument, eh?' smirked the blonde witch behind the desk. 'You're the third I've seen today . . . Spell Damage, fourth floor.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 They found Mr Weasley propped up in bed with the remains of his turkey dinner on a tray on his lap and a rather sheepish expression on his face.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Everything all right, Arthur?' asked Mrs Weasley, after they had all greeted Mr Weasley and handed over their presents.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Fine, fine,' said Mr Weasley, a little too heartily. 'You - er - 'haven't seen Healer Smethwyck, have you?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'No,' said Mrs Weasley suspiciously, 'why?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Nothing, nothing,' said Mr Weasley airily, starting to unwrap his pile of gifts. 'Well, everyone had a good day? What did you all get for Christmas? Oh, Harry - this is absolutely wonderful!' For he had just opened Harry's gift of fuse-wire and screwdrivers.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Mrs Weasley did not seem entirely satisfied with Mr Weasley's answer. As her husband leaned over to shake Harry's hand, she peered at the bandaging under his nightshirt.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Arthur,' she said, with a snap in her voice like a mousetrap, 'you've had your bandages changed. Why have you had your bandages changed a day early, Arthur? They told me they wouldn't need doing until tomorrow.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'What?' said Mr Weasley, looking rather frightened and pulling the bed covers higher up his chest. 'No, no - it's nothing - it's - 'I - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He seemed to deflate under Mrs Weasley's piercing gaze.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Well - now don't get upset, Molly, but Augustus Pye had an idea . . . he's the Trainee Healer, you know, lovely young chap and very interested in . . . um . . . complementary medicine . . . I mean, some of these old Muggle remedies . . . well, they're called stitches, Molly, and they work very well on - on Muggle wounds - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Mrs Weasley let out an ominous noise somewhere between a shriek and a snarl. Lupin strolled away from the bed and over to the werewolf, who had no visitors and was looking rather wistfully at the crowd around Mr Weasley; Bill muttered something s.bout getting himself a cup of tea and Fred and George leapt up to accompany him, grinning.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Do you mean to tell me,' said Mrs Weasley, her voice growing louder with every word and apparently unaware that her fellow visitors were scurrying for cover, 'that you have been messing about with Muggle remedies?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Not messing about, Molly, dear,' said Mr Weasley imploringly, 'it was just - just something Pye and I thought we'd try - only, most unfortunately - well, with these particular kinds of wounds - it doesn't seem to work as well as we'd hoped - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Meaning?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well . . . well, I don't know whether you know what - what stitches are?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'It sounds as though you've been trying to sew your skin back together,' said Mrs Weasley with a snort of mirthless laughter, 'but even you, Arthur, wouldn't be that stupid - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I fancy a cup of tea, too,' said Harry, jumping to his feet.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Hermione, Ron and Ginny almost sprinted to the door with him. As it swung closed behind them, they heard Mrs Weasley shriek, 'WHAT DO YOU MEAN, THAT'S THE GENERAL IDEA?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Typical Dad,' said Ginny, shaking her head as they set off up the corridor. 'Stitches . . . I ask you . . .'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well, you know, they do work well on non-magical wounds,' said Hermione fairly. 'I suppose something in that snake's venom dissolves them or something. I wonder where the tearoom is?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Fifth floor,' said Harry, remembering the sign over the welcomewitch's desk.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 They walked along the corridor, through a set of double doors and found a rickety staircase lined with more portraits of brutal-looking Healers. As they climbed it, the various Healers called out to them, diagnosing odd complaints and suggesting horrible remedies. Ron was seriously affronted when a medieval wizard called out that he clearly had a bad case of spattergroit.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'And what's that supposed to be?' he asked angrily, as the Healer pursued him through six more portraits, shoving the occupants out of the way.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 ' 'Tis a most grievous affliction of the skin, young master, that will leave you pockmarked and more gruesome even than you are now - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Watch who you're calling gruesome!' said Ron, his ears turning red.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 ' - the only remedy is to take the liver of a toad, bind it tight about your throat, stand naked at the full moon in a barrel of eels' eyes - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I have not got spattergroit!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'But the unsightly blemishes upon your visage, young master - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'They're freckles!' said Ron furiously. 'Now get back in your own picture and leave me alone!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He rounded on the others, who were all keeping determinedly straight faces.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'What floor's this?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I think it's the fifth,' said Hermione.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Nah, it's the fourth,' said Harry, 'one more -\\u00a0 \\u00a0 But as he stepped on to the landing he came to an abrupt halt, staring at the small window set into the double doors that marked the start of a corridor signposted SPELL DAMAGE. A man was peering out at them all with his nose pressed against the glass. He had wavy blond hair, bright blue eyes and a broad vacant smile that revealed dazzlingly white teeth.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Blimey!' said Ron, also staring at the man.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Oh, my goodness,' said Hermione suddenly, sounding breathless. 'Professor Lockhart.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Their ex-Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher pushed open the doors and moved towards them, wearing a long lilac dressing gown.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well, hello there!' he said. 'I expect you'd like my autograph, would you?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Hasn't changed much, has he?' Harry muttered to Ginny, who grinned.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Er - how are you, Professor?' said Ron, sounding slightly guilty. It had been Ron's malfunctioning wand that had damaged Professor Lockhart's memory so badly that he had landed in St Mungo's in the first place, though as Lockhart had been attempting to permanently wipe Harry and Ron's memories at the time, Harry's sympathy was limited.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I'm very well indeed, thank you!' said Lockhart exuberantly, palling a rather battered peacock-feather quill from his pocket. 'Mow, how many autographs would you like? I can do joined-up writing now, you know!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Er - we don't want any at the moment, thanks,' said Ron, raising his eyebrows at Harry, who asked, 'Professor, should you be wandering around the corridors? Shouldn't you be in a ward?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 The smile faded slowly from Lockhart's face. For a few moments he gazed intently at Harry, then he said, 'Haven't we met?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Er . . . yeah, we have,' said Harry. 'You used to teach us at Hogwarts, remember?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Teach?' repeated Lockhart, looking faintly unsettled. 'Me? Did I?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 And then the smile reappeared upon his face so suddenly it was rather alarming.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Taught you everything you know, I expect, did I? Well, how about those autographs, then? Shall we say a round dozen, you can give them to all your little friends then and nobody will be left out!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 But just then a head poked out of a door at the far end of the corridor and a voice called, 'Gilderoy, you naughty boy, where have you wandered off to?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 A motherly-looking Healer wearing a tinsel wreath in her hair came bustling up the corridor, smiling warmly at Harry and the others.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Oh, Gilderoy, you've got visitors! How lovely, and on Christmas Day, too! Do you know, he never gets visitors, poor lamb, and I can't think why, he's such a sweetie, aren't you?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'We're doing autographs!' Gilderoy told the Healer with another glittering smile. They want loads of them, won't take no for an answer! I just hope we've got enough photographs!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Listen to him,' said the Healer, taking Lockhart's arm and beaming fondly at him as though he were a precocious two-year-old. 'He was rather well known a few years ago; we very much hope that this liking for giving autographs is a sign that his memory might be starting to come back. Will you step this way? He's in a closed ward, you know, he must have slipped out while I was bringing in the Christmas presents, the door's usually kept locked . . . not that he's dangerous! But,' she lowered her voice to a whisper, 'he's a bit of a danger to himself, bless him . . . doesn't know who he is, you see, wanders off and can't remember how to get back . . . it is nice of you to have come to see him.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Er,' said Ron, gesturing uselessly at the floor above, 'actually, we were just - er -'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 But the Healer was smiling expectantly at them, and Ron's feeble mutter of 'going to have a cup of tea' trailed away into nothingness. They looked at each other helplessly, then followed Lockhart and his Healer along the corridor.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Let's not stay long,' Ron said quietly.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 The Healer pointed her wand at the door of the Janus Thickey Ward and muttered, 'Alohomora.' The door swung open and she led the way inside, keeping a firm grasp on Gilderoy's arm until she had settled him into an armchair beside his bed.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 This is our long-term residents' ward,' she informed Harry, Ron,\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Hermione and Ginny in a low voice. 'For permanent spell damage, you know. Of course, with intensive remedial potions and charms and a bit of luck, we can produce some improvement. Gilderoy does seem to be getting back some sense of himself; and we've seen a real improvement in Mr Bode, he seems to be regaining the power of speech very well, though he isn't speaking any language w: recognise yet. Well, I must finish giving out the Christmas presents, I'll leave you all to chat.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry looked around. The ward bore unmistakeable signs of being a permanent home to its residents. They had many more personal effects around their beds than in Mr Weasley's ward; the wall around Gilderoy's headboard, for instance, was papered with pictures of himself, all beaming toothily and waving at the new arrivals. He had autographed many of them to himself in disjointed, childish writing. The moment he had been deposited in his chair b> the Healer, Gilderoy pulled a fresh stack of photographs towards him, seized a quill and started signing them all feverishly.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'You can put them in envelopes,' he said to Ginny, throwing the signed pictures into her lap one by one as he finished them. 'I am not forgotten, you know, no, I still receive a very great deal of fan mail . . . Gladys Gudgeon writes weekly . . . I just wish I knew why . . .' He paused, looking faintly puzzled, then beamed again and returned to his signing with renewed vigour. 'I suspect it is simply my good looks . . .'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 A sallow-skinned, mournful-looking wizard lay in the bed opposite staring at the ceiling; he was mumbling to himself and seemed quite unaware of anything around him. Two beds along was a woman whose entire head was covered in fur; Harry remembered something similar happening to Hermione during their second year, although fortunately the damage, in her case, had not been permanent. At the far end of the ward flowery curtains had been drawn around two beds to give the occupants and their visitors some privacy.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Here you are, Agnes,' said the Healer brightly to the furry-faced woman, handing her a small pile of Christmas presents. 'See, not forgotten, are you? And your son's sent an owl to say he's visiting tonight, so that's nice, isn't it?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Agnes gave several loud barks.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'And look, Broderick, you've been sent a pot plant and a lovely calendar with a different fancy Hippogriff for each month; they'll brighten things up, won't they?' said the Healer, bustling along to the mumbling man, setting a rather ugly plant with long, swaying tentacles on the bedside cabinet and fixing the calendar to the wall with her wand. 'And - oh, Mrs Longbottom, are you leaving already?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry's head span round. The curtains had been drawn back from the two beds at the end of the ward and two visitors were walking back down the aisle between the beds: a formidable-looking old witch wearing a long green dress, a moth-eaten fox fur and a pointed hat decorated with what was unmistakeably a stuffed vulture and, trailing behind her looking thoroughly depressed - Neville.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 With a sudden rush of understanding, Harry realised who the people in the end beds must be. He cast around wildly for some means of distracting the others so that Neville could leave the ward unnoticed and unquestioned, but Ron had also looked up at the sound of the name 'Longbottom', and before Harry could stop him had called out, 'Neville!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Neville jumped and cowered as though a bullet had narrowly missed him.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'It's us, Neville!' said Ron brightly, getting to his feet. 'Have you seen - '? Lockhart's here! Who've you been visiting?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Friends of yours, Neville, dear?' said Neville's grandmother graciously, bearing down upon them all.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Neville looked as though he would rather be anywhere in the world but here. A dull purple flush was creeping up his plump face and he was not making eye contact with any of them.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Ah, yes,' said his grandmother, looking closely at Harry and sticking out a shrivelled, clawlike hand for him to shake. 'Yes, yes, I know who you are, of course. Neville speaks most highly of you.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Er - thanks,' said Harry, shaking hands. Neville did not look at him, but surveyed his own feet, the colour deepening in his face all the while.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'And you two are clearly Weasleys,' Mrs Longbottom continued, proffering her hand regally to Ron and Ginny in turn. 'Yes, I know your parents - not well, of course - but fine people, fine people . . . and you must be Hermione Granger?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Hermione looked rather startled that Mrs Longbottom knew her name, but shook hands all the same.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yes, Neville's told me all about you. Helped him out of a few sticky spots, haven't you? He's a good boy,' she said, casting a sternly appraising look down her rather bony nose at Neville, 'but be hasn't got his father's talent, I'm afraid to say.' And she jerked her head in the direction of the two beds at the end of the ward, so that the stuffed vulture on her hat trembled alarmingly.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'What?' said Ron, looking amazed. (Harry wanted to stamp on Ron's foot, but that sort of thing is much harder to bring off unnoticed when you're wearing jeans rather than robes.) 'Is that your dad down the end, Neville?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'What's this?' said Mrs Longbottom sharply. 'Haven't you told your friends about your parents, Neville?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Neville took a deep breath, looked up at the ceiling and shook his head. Harry could not remember ever feeling sorrier for anyone, but he could not think of any way of helping Neville out of the situation.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Well, it's nothing to be ashamed of!' said Mrs Longbottom angrily. 'You should be proud, Neville, proud! They didn't give their health and their sanity so their only son would be ashamed of them, you know!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I'm not ashamed,' said Neville, very faintly, still looking anywhere but at Harry and the others. Ron was now standing on tiptoe to look over at the inhabitants of the two beds.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Well, you've got a funny way of showing it!' said Mrs Longbottom. 'My son and his wife,' she said, turning haughtily to Harry, Ron, Hermione and Ginny, 'were tortured into insanity by You-Know-Who's followers.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Hermione and Ginny both clapped their hands over their mouths. Ron stopped craning his neck to catch a glimpse of Neville's parents and looked mortified.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 They were Aurors, you know, and very well respected within the wizarding community,' Mrs Longbottom went on. 'Highly gifted, the pair of them. I - yes, Alice dear, what is it?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Neville's mother had come edging down the ward in her nightdress. She no longer had the plump, happy-looking face Harry had seen in Moody's old photograph of the original Order of the Phoenix. Her face was thin and worn now, her eyes seemed overlarge and her hair, which had turned white, was wispy and dead-looking. She did not seem to want to speak, or perhaps she was not able to, but she made timid motions towards Neville, holding something in her outstretched hand.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Again?' said Mrs Longbottom, sounding slightly weary. 'Very well, Alice dear, very well - Neville, take it, whatever it is.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 But Neville had already stretched out his hand, into which his mother dropped an empty Drooble's Best Blowing Gum wrapper.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Very nice, dear,' said Neville's grandmother in a falsely cheery voice, patting his mother on the shoulder.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 But Neville said quietly, Thanks, Mum.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 His mother tottered away, back up the ward, humming to herself. Neville looked around at the others, his expression defiant, as though daring them to laugh, but Harry did not think he'd ever found anything less funny in his life.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well, we'd better get back,' sighed Mrs Longbottom, drawing on long green gloves. 'Very nice to have met you all. Neville, put that wrapper in the bin, she must have given you enough of them to paper your bedroom by now.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 But as they left, Harry was sure he saw Neville slip the sweet wrapper into his pocket.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 The door closed behind them.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I never knew,' said Hermione, who looked tearful.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Nor did I,' said Ron rather hoarsely.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Nor me,' whispered Ginny.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 They all looked at Harry.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I did,' he said glumly. 'Dumbledore told me but I promised I wouldn't tell anyone . . . that's what Bellatrix Lestrange got sent to Azkaban for, using the Cruciatus Curse on Neville's parents until they lost their minds.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Bellatrix Lestrange did that?' whispered Hermione, horrified. That woman Kreacher's got a photo of in his den?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 There was a long silence, broken by Lockhart's angry voice.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Look, I didn't learn joined-up writing for nothing, you know!'\\\"\",\n          \"THROUGH THE TRAPDOOR  In years to come, Harry would never quite remember how he had managed to get through his exams when he half expected Voldemort to come bursting through the door at any moment. Yet the days crept by, and there could be no doubt that Fluffy was still alive and well behind the locked door.  It was sweltering hot, especially in the large classroom where they did their written papers. They had been given special, new quills for the exams, which had been bewitched with an AntiCheating spell.  They had practical exams as well. Professor Flitwick called them one by one into his class to see if they could make a pineapple tapdance across a desk. Professor McGonagall watched them turn a mouse into a snuffbox -- points were given for how pretty the snuffbox was, but taken away if it had whiskers. Snape made them all nervous, breathing down their necks while they tried to remember how to make a Forgetfulness potion.  Harry did the best he could, trying to ignore the stabbing pains in his forehead, which had been bothering him ever since his trip into the forest. Neville thought Harry had a bad case of exam nerves because Harry couldn't sleep, but the truth was that Harry kept being woken by his old nightmare, except that it was now worse than ever because there was a hooded figure dripping blood in it.  Maybe it was because they hadn't seen what Harry had seen in the forest, or because they didn't have scars burning on their foreheads, but Ron and Hermione didn't seem as worried about the Stone as Harry. The idea of Voldemort certainly scared them, but he didn't keep visiting them in dreams, and they were so busy with their studying they didn't have much time to fret about what Snape or anyone else might be up to.  Their very last exam was History of Magic. One hour of answering questions about batty old wizards who'd invented selfstirring cauldrons and they'd be free, free for a whole wonderful week until their exam results came out. When the ghost of Professor Binns told them to put down their quills and roll up their parchment, Harry couldn't help cheering with the rest.  \\\\That was far easier than I thought it would be,\\\\\\\" said Hermione as they joined the crowds flocking out onto the sunny grounds. \\\\\\\"I needn't have learned about the 1637 Werewolf Code of Conduct or the uprising of Elfric the Eager.\\\\\\\"  Hermione always liked to go through their exam papers afterward, but Ron said this made him feel ill, so they wandered down to the lake and flopped under a tree. The Weasley twins and Lee Jordan were tickling the tentacles of a giant squid, which was basking in the warm shallows. \\\\\\\"No more studying,\\\\\\\" Ron sighed happily, stretching out on the grass. \\\\\\\"You could look more cheerful, Harry, we've got a week before we find out how badly we've done, there's no need to worry yet.\\\\\\\"  Harry was rubbing his forehead.  \\\\\\\"I wish I knew what this means!\\\\\\\" he burst out angrily. \\\\\\\"My scar keeps hurting -- it's happened before, but never as often as this.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Go to Madam Pomfrey,\\\\\\\" Hermione suggested.  \\\\\\\"I'm not ill,\\\\\\\" said Harry. \\\\\\\"I think it's a warning... it means danger's coming....\\\\\\\"  Ron couldn't get worked up, it was too hot.  \\\\\\\"Harry, relax, Hermione's right, the Stone's safe as long as Dumbledore's around. Anyway, we've never had any proof Snape found out how to get past Fluffy. He nearly had his leg ripped off once, he's not going to try it again in a hurry. And Neville will play Quidditch for England before Hagrid lets Dumbledore down.\\\\\\\"  Harry nodded, but he couldn't shake off a lurking feeling that there was something he'd forgotten to do, something important. When he tried to explain this, Hermione said, \\\\\\\"That's just the exams. I woke up last night and was halfway through my Transfiguration notes before I remembered we'd done that one.\\\\\\\"  Harry was quite sure the unsettled feeling didn't have anything to do with work, though. He watched an owl flutter toward the school across the bright blue sky, a note clamped in its mouth. Hagrid was the only one who ever sent him letters. Hagrid would never betray Dumbledore. Hagrid would never tell anyone how to get past Fluffy... never... but --  Harry suddenly jumped to his feet.  \\\\\\\"Where're you going?\\\\\\\" said Ron sleepily.   \\\\\\\"I've just thought of something,\\\\\\\" said Harry. He had turned white. \\\\\\\"We've got to go and see Hagrid, now.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Why?\\\\\\\" panted Hermione, hurrying to keep up.  \\\\\\\"Don't you think it's a bit odd,\\\\\\\" said Harry, scrambling up the grassy slope, \\\\\\\"that what Hagrid wants more than anything else is a dragon, and a stranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in his pocket? How many people wander around with dragon eggs if it's against wizard law? Lucky they found Hagrid, don't you think? Why didn't I see it before?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"What are you talking about?\\\\\\\" said Ron, but Harry, sprinting across the grounds toward the forest, didn't answer.  Hagrid was sitting in an armchair outside his house; his trousers and sleeves were rolled up, and he was shelling peas into a large bowl.  \\\\\\\"Hullo,\\\\\\\" he said, smiling. \\\\\\\"Finished yer exams? Got time fer a drink?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Yes, please,\\\\\\\" said Ron, but Harry cut him off.  \\\\\\\"No, we're in a hurry. Hagrid, I've got to ask you something. You know that night you won Norbert? What did the stranger you were playing cards with look like?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Dunno,\\\\\\\" said Hagrid casually, \\\\\\\"he wouldn' take his cloak off.\\\\\\\"  He saw the three of them look stunned and raised his eyebrows.  \\\\\\\"It's not that unusual, yeh get a lot o' funny folk in the Hog's Head -- that's the pub down in the village. Mighta bin a dragon dealer, mightn' he? I never saw his face, he kept his hood up.\\\\\\\"  Harry sank down next to the bowl of peas. \\\\\\\"What did you talk to him about, Hagrid? Did you mention Hogwarts at all?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Mighta come up,\\\\\\\" said Hagrid, frowning as he tried to remember. \\\\\\\"Yeah... he asked what I did, an' I told him I was gamekeeper here.... He asked a bit about the sorta creatures I took after... so I told him... an' I said what I'd always really wanted was a dragon... an' then... I can' remember too well, 'cause he kept buyin' me drinks.... Let's see... yeah, then he said he had the dragon egg an' we could play cards fer it if I wanted... but he had ter be sure I could handle it, he didn' want it ter go ter any old home.... So I told him, after Fluffy, a dragon would be easy...\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"And did he -- did he seem interested in Fluffy?\\\\\\\" Harry asked, try ing to keep his voice calm.  \\\\\\\"Well -- yeah -- how many three-headed dogs d'yeh meet, even around Hogwarts? So I told him, Fluffy's a piece o' cake if yeh know how to calm him down, jus' play him a bit o' music an' he'll go straight off ter sleep --\\\\\\\"  Hagrid suddenly looked horrified.  \\\\\\\"I shouldn'ta told yeh that!\\\\\\\" he blurted out. \\\\\\\"Forget I said it! Hey -- where're yeh goin'?\\\\\\\"  Harry, Ron, and Hermione didn't speak to each other at all until they came to a halt in the entrance hall, which seemed very cold and gloomy after the grounds.  \\\\\\\"We've got to go to Dumbledore,\\\\\\\" said Harry. \\\\\\\"Hagrid told that stranger how to get past Fluffy, and it was either Snape or Voldemort under that cloak -- it must've been easy, once he'd got Hagrid drunk. I just hope Dumbledore believes us. Firenze might back us up if Bane doesn't stop him. Where's Dumbledore's office?\\\\\\\"  They looked around, as if hoping to see a sign pointing them in the right direction. They had never been told where Dumbledore lived, nor did they know anyone who had been sent to see him.  \\\\\\\"We'll just have to --\\\\\\\" Harry began, but a voice suddenly rang across the hall.  \\\\\\\"What are you three doing inside?\\\\\\\"  It was Professor McGonagall, carrying a large pile of books.  \\\\\\\"We want to see Professor Dumbledore,\\\\\\\" said Hermione, rather bravely, Harry and Ron thought.  \\\\\\\"See Professor Dumbledore?\\\\\\\" Professor McGonagall repeated, as though this was a very fishy thing to want to do. \\\\\\\"Why?\\\\\\\"  Harry swallowed -- now what?  \\\\\\\"It's sort of secret,\\\\\\\" he said, but he wished at once he hadn't, because Professor McGonagall's nostrils flared.  \\\\\\\"Professor Dumbledore left ten minutes ago,\\\\\\\" she said coldly. \\\\\\\"He received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and flew off for London at once.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"He's gone?\\\\\\\" said Harry frantically. \\\\\\\"Now?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Professor Dumbledore is a very great wizard, Potter, he has many demands on his time --  \\\\\\\"But this is important.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Something you have to say is more important than the Ministry of Magic, Potter.  \\\\\\\"Look,\\\\\\\" said Harry, throwing caution to the winds, \\\\\\\"Professor -- it's about the Sorcerer's tone --\\\\\\\"  Whatever Professor McGonagall had expected, it wasn't that. The books she was carrying tumbled out of her arms, but she didn't pick them up. \\\\\\\"How do you know --?\\\\\\\" she spluttered.  \\\\\\\"Professor, I think -- I know -- that Sn- that someone's going to try and steal the Stone. I've got to talk to Professor Dumbledore.\\\\\\\"  She eyed him with a mixture of shock and suspicion.  \\\\\\\"Professor Dumbledore will be back tomorrow,\\\\\\\" she said finally. I don't know how you found out about the Stone, but rest assured, no one can possibly steal it, it's too well protected.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"But Professor --\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Potter, I know what I'm talking about,\\\\\\\" she said shortly. She bent down and gathered up the fallen books. I suggest you all go back outside and enjoy the sunshine.\\\\\\\"  But they didn't.  \\\\\\\"It's tonight,\\\\\\\" said Harry, once he was sure Professor McGonagall was out of earshot. \\\\\\\"Snape's going through the trapdoor tonight. He's found out everything he needs, and now he's got Dumbledore out of the way. He sent that note, I bet the Ministry of Magic will get a real shock when Dumbledore turns up.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"But what can we --\\\\\\\"  Hermione gasped. Harry and Ron wheeled round.  Snape was standing there.  \\\\\\\"Good afternoon,\\\\\\\" he said smoothly.  They stared at him.  \\\\\\\"You shouldn't be inside on a day like this,\\\\\\\" he said, with an odd, twisted smile.  \\\\\\\"We were --\\\\\\\" Harry began, without any idea what he was going to say.  \\\\\\\"You want to be more careful,\\\\\\\" said Snape. \\\\\\\"Hanging around  like this, people will think you're up to something. And Gryffindor really can't afford to lose any more points, can it?\\\\\\\"  Harry flushed. They turned to go outside, but Snape called them back.  \\\\\\\"Be warned, Potter -- any more nighttime wanderings and I will personally make sure you are expelled. Good day to you.\\\\\\\"  He strode off in the direction of the staffroom.  Out on the stone steps, Harry turned to the others.  \\\\\\\"Right, here's what we've got to do,\\\\\\\" he whispered urgently. \\\\\\\"One of us has got to keep an eye on Snape -- wait outside the staff room and follow him if he leaves it. Hermione, you'd better do that.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Why me?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"It's obvious,\\\\\\\" said Ron. \\\\\\\"You can pretend to be waiting for Professor Flitwick, you know.\\\\\\\" He put on a high voice, \\\\\\\"'Oh Professor Flitwick, I'm so worried, I think I got question fourteen b wrong....'\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Oh, shut up,\\\\\\\" said Hermione, but she agreed to go and watch out for Snape.  \\\\\\\"And we'd better stay outside the third-floor corridor,\\\\\\\" Harry told Ron. \\\\\\\"Come on.\\\\\\\"  But that part of the plan didn't work. No sooner had they reached the door separating Fluffy from the rest of the school than Professor McGonagall turned up again and this time, she lost her temper.  \\\\\\\"I suppose you think you're harder to get past than a pack of enchantments!\\\\\\\" she stormed. \\\\\\\"Enough of this nonsense! If I hear you 've come anywhere near here again, I'll take another fifty points from Gryffindor! Yes, Weasley, from my own house!\\\\\\\" Harry and Ron went back to the common room, Harry had just said, \\\\\\\"At least Hermione's on Snape's tail,\\\\\\\" when the portrait of the Fat Lady swung open and Hermione came in.  \\\\\\\"I'm sorry, Harry!\\\\\\\" she wailed. \\\\\\\"Snape came out and asked me what I was doing, so I said I was waiting for Flitwick, and Snape went to get him, and I've only just got away, I don't know where Snape went.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Well, that's it then, isn't it?\\\\\\\" Harry said.  The other two stared at him. He was pale and his eyes were glittering.  \\\\\\\"I'm going out of here tonight and I'm going to try and get to the Stone first.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"You're mad!\\\\\\\" said Ron.  \\\\\\\"You can't!\\\\\\\" said Hermione. \\\\\\\"After what McGonagall and Snape have said? You'll be expelled!\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"SO WHAP\\\\\\\" Harry shouted. \\\\\\\"Don't you understand? If Snape gets hold of the Stone, Voldemort's coming back! Haven't you heard what it was like when he was trying to take over? There won't be any Hogwarts to get expelled from! He'll flatten it, or turn it into a school for the Dark Arts! Losing points doesn't matter anymore, can't you see? D'you think he'll leave you and your families alone if Gryffindor wins the house cup? If I get caught before I can get to the Stone, well, I'll have to go back to the Dursleys and wait for Voldemort to find me there, it's only dying a bit later than I would have, because I'm never going over to the Dark Side! I'm going through that trapdoor tonight and nothing you two say is going to stop me! Voldemort killed my parents, remember?\\\\\\\"  He glared at them.  \\\\\\\"You're right Harry,\\\\\\\" said Hermione in a small voice.  \\\\\\\"I'll use the invisibility cloak,\\\\\\\" said Harry. \\\\\\\"It's just lucky I got it back.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"But will it cover all three of us?\\\\\\\" said Ron.  \\\\\\\"All -- all three of us?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Oh, come off it, you don't think we'd let you go alone?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Of course not,\\\\\\\" said Hermione briskly. \\\\\\\"How do you think you'd get to the Stone without us? I'd better go and took through my books, there might be something useful...\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"But if we get caught, you two will be expelled, too.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Not if I can help it,\\\\\\\" said Hermione grimly. \\\\\\\"Flitwick told me in secret that I got a hundred and twelve percent on his exam. They're not throwing me out after that.\\\\\\\"  After dinner the three of them sat nervously apart in the common room. Nobody bothered them; none of the Gryffindors had anything to say to Harry any more, after all. This was the first night he hadn't been upset by it. Hermione was skimming through all her notes, hoping to come across one of the enchantments they were about to try to break. Harry and Ron didn't talk much. Both of them were thinking about what they were about to do.  Slowly, the room emptied as people drifted off to bed.  \\\\\\\"Better get the cloak,\\\\\\\" Ron muttered, as Lee Jordan finally left, stretching and yawning. Harry ran upstairs to their dark dormitory. He putted out the cloak and then his eyes fell on the flute Hagrid had given him for Christmas. He pocketed it to use on Fluffy -- he didn't feel much like singing.  He ran back down to the common room.  \\\\\\\"We'd better put the cloak on here, and make sure it covers all three of us -- if Filch spots one of our feet wandering along on its own --\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"What are you doing?\\\\\\\" said a voice from the corner of the room. Neville appeared from behind an armchair, clutching Trevor the toad, who looked as though he'd been making another bid for freedom.  \\\\\\\"Nothing, Neville, nothing,\\\\\\\" said Harry, hurriedly putting the cloak behind his back.  Neville stared at their guilty faces.  \\\\\\\"You're going out again,\\\\\\\" he said.  \\\\\\\"No, no, no,\\\\\\\" said Hermione. \\\\\\\"No, we're not. Why don't you go to bed, Neville?\\\\\\\"  Harry looked at the grandfather clock by the door. They couldn't afford to waste any more time, Snape might even now be playing Fluffy to sleep.  \\\\\\\"You can't go out,\\\\\\\" said Neville, \\\\\\\"you'll be caught again. Gryffindor will be in even more trouble.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"You don't understand,\\\\\\\" said Harry, \\\\\\\"this is important.\\\\\\\"  But Neville was clearly steeling himself to do something desperate.  I won't let you do it,\\\\\\\" he said, hurrying to stand in front of the portrait hole. \\\\\\\"I'll -- I'll fight you!\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Neville, \\\\\\\"Ron exploded, \\\\\\\"get away from that hole and don't be an idiot --\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Don't you call me an idiot!\\\\\\\" said Neville. I don't think you should be breaking any more rules! And you were the one who told me to stand up to people!\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Yes, but not to us,\\\\\\\" said Ron in exasperation. \\\\\\\"Neville, you don't know what you're doing.\\\\\\\"  He took a step forward and Neville dropped Trevor the toad, who leapt out of sight.  \\\\\\\"Go on then, try and hit me!\\\\\\\" said Neville, raising his fists. \\\\\\\"I'm ready!\\\\\\\"  Harry turned to Hermione.  \\\\\\\"Do something,\\\\\\\" he said desperately.  Hermione stepped forward.  \\\\\\\"Neville,\\\\\\\" she said, \\\\\\\"I'm really, really sorry about this.\\\\\\\"  She raised her wand.  \\\\\\\"Petrificus Totalus!\\\\\\\" she cried, pointing it at Neville.  Neville's arms snapped to his sides. His legs sprang together. His whole body rigid, he swayed where he stood and then fell flat on his face, stiff as a board.  Hermione ran to turn him over. Neville's jaws were jammed together so he couldn't speak. Only his eyes were moving, looking at them in horror.  \\\\\\\"What've you done to him?\\\\\\\" Harry whispered.  \\\\\\\"It's the full Body-Bind,\\\\\\\" said Hermione miserably. \\\\\\\"Oh, Neville, I'm so sorry.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"We had to, Neville, no time to explain,\\\\\\\" said Harry.  \\\\\\\"You'll understand later, Neville,\\\\\\\" said Ron as they stepped over him and pulled on the invisibility cloak.  But leaving Neville lying motionless on the floor didn't feel like a very good omen. In their nervous state, every statue's shadow looked like Filch, every distant breath of wind sounded like Peeves swooping down on them. At the foot of the first set of stairs, they spotted Mrs. Norris skulking near the top.  \\\\\\\"Oh, let's kick her, just this once,\\\\\\\" Ron whispered in Harry's ear, but Harry shook his head. As they climbed carefully around her, Mrs. Norris turned her lamplike eyes on them, but didn't do anything.  They didn't meet anyone else until they reached the staircase up to the third floor. Peeves was bobbing halfway up, loosening the carpet so that people would trip.  \\\\\\\"Who's there?\\\\\\\" he said suddenly as they climbed toward him. He narrowed his wicked black eyes. \\\\\\\"Know you're there, even if I can't see you. Are you ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie?\\\\\\\"  He rose up in the air and floated there, squinting at them.  \\\\\\\"Should call Filch, I should, if something's a-creeping around unseen.\\\\\\\"  Harry had a sudden idea.  \\\\\\\"Peeves,\\\\\\\" he said, in a hoarse whisper, \\\\\\\"the Bloody Baron has his own reasons for being invisible.\\\\\\\"  Peeves almost fell out of the air in shock. He caught himself in time and hovered about a foot off the stairs.  \\\\\\\"So sorry, your bloodiness, Mr. Baron, Sir,\\\\\\\" he said greasily. \\\\\\\"My mistake, my mistake -- I didn't see you -- of course I didn't, you're invisible -- forgive old Peevsie his little joke, sir.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"I have business here, Peeves,\\\\\\\" croaked Harry. \\\\\\\"Stay away from this place tonight.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"I will, sir, I most certainly will,\\\\\\\" said Peeves, rising up in the air again. \\\\\\\"Hope your business goes well, Baron, I'll not bother you.\\\\\\\"  And he scooted off  \\\\\\\"Brilliant, Harry!\\\\\\\" whispered Ron.  A few seconds later, they were there, outside the third-floor corridor -- and the door was already ajar.  \\\\\\\"Well, there you are,\\\\\\\" Harry said quietly, \\\\\\\"Snape's already got past Fluffy.\\\\\\\"  Seeing the open door somehow seemed to impress upon all three of them what was facing them. Underneath the cloak, Harry turned to the other two.  \\\\\\\"If you want to go back, I won't blame you,\\\\\\\" he said. \\\\\\\"You can take the cloak, I won't need it now.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Don't be stupid,\\\\\\\" said Ron.  \\\\\\\"We're coming,\\\\\\\" said Hermione.  Harry pushed the door open.  As the door creaked, low, rumbling growls met their ears. All three of the dog's noses sniffed madly in their direction, even though it couldn't see them.  \\\\\\\"What's that at its feet?\\\\\\\" Hermione whispered.  \\\\\\\"Looks like a harp,\\\\\\\" said Ron. \\\\\\\"Snape must have left it there.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"It must wake up the moment you stop playing,\\\\\\\" said Harry. \\\\\\\"Well, here goes...\\\\\\\"  He put Hagrid's flute to his lips and blew. It wasn't really a tune, but from the first note the beast's eyes began to droop. Harry hardly drew breath. Slowly, the dog's growls ceased -- it tottered on its paws and fell to its knees, then it slumped to the ground, fast asleep.  \\\\\\\"Keep playing,\\\\\\\" Ron warned Harry as they slipped out of the cloak and crept toward the trapdoor. They could feel the dog's hot, smelly breath as they approached the giant heads. \\\\\\\"I think we'll be able to pull the door open,\\\\\\\" said Ron, peering over the dog's back. \\\\\\\"Want to go first, Hermione?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"No, I don't!\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"All right.\\\\\\\" Ron gritted his teeth and stepped carefully over the dog's legs. He bent and pulled the ring of the trapdoor, which swung up and open.  \\\\\\\"What can you see?\\\\\\\" Hermione said anxiously.  \\\\\\\"Nothing -- just black -- there's no way of climbing down, we'll just have to drop.\\\\\\\"  Harry, who was still playing the flute, waved at Ron to get his attention and pointed at himself.  \\\\\\\"You want to go first? Are you sure?\\\\\\\" said Ron. \\\\\\\"I don't know how deep this thing goes. Give the flute to Hermione so she can keep him asleep.\\\\\\\"  Harry handed the flute over. In the few seconds' silence, the dog growled and twitched, but the moment Hermione began to play, it fell back into its deep sleep.  Harry climbed over it and looked down through the trapdoor. There was no sign of the bottom.  He lowered himself through the hole until he was hanging on by his fingertips. Then he looked up at Ron and said, \\\\\\\"If anything happens to me, don't follow. Go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, right?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Right,\\\\\\\" said Ron.  \\\\\\\"See you in a minute, I hope...  And Harry let go. Cold, damp air rushed past him as he fell down, down, down and -- FLUMP. With a funny, muffled sort of thump he landed on something soft. He sat up and felt around, his eyes not used to the gloom. It felt as though he was sitting on some sort of plant.  \\\\\\\"It's okay!\\\\\\\" he called up to the light the size of a postage stamp, which was the open trapdoor, \\\\\\\"it's a soft landing, you can jump!\\\\\\\"  Ron followed right away. He landed, sprawled next to Harry.  \\\\\\\"What's this stuff?\\\\\\\" were his first words.  \\\\\\\"Dunno, some sort of plant thing. I suppose it's here to break the fall. Come on, Hermione!\\\\\\\"  The distant music stopped. There was a loud bark from the dog, but Hermione had already jumped. She landed on Harry's other side.  \\\\\\\"We must be miles under the school , she said.  \\\\\\\"Lucky this plant thing's here, really,\\\\\\\" said Ron.  \\\\\\\"Lucky!\\\\\\\" shrieked Hermione. \\\\\\\"Look at you both!\\\\\\\"  She leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall. She had to struggle because the moment she had landed, the plant had started to twist snakelike tendrils around her ankles. As for Harry and Ron, their legs had already been bound tightly in long creepers without their noticing.  Hermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm grip on her. Now she watched in horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant off them, but the more they strained against it, the tighter and faster the plant wound around them.  \\\\\\\"Stop moving!\\\\\\\" Hermione ordered them. \\\\\\\"I know what this is -- it's Devil's Snare!\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Oh, I'm so glad we know what it's called, that's a great help,\\\\\\\" snarled Ron, leaning back, trying to stop the plant from curling around his neck. \\\\\\\"Shut up, I'm trying to remember how to kill it!\\\\\\\" said Hermione.  \\\\\\\"Well, hurry up, I can't breathe!\\\\\\\" Harry gasped, wrestling with it as it curled around his chest.  \\\\\\\"Devil's Snare, Devil's Snare... what did Professor Sprout say? -- it likes the dark and the damp  \\\\\\\"So light a fire!\\\\\\\" Harry choked.  \\\\\\\"Yes -- of course -- but there's no wood!\\\\\\\" Hermione cried, wringing her hands.  \\\\\\\"HAVE YOU GONE MAD?\\\\\\\" Ron bellowed. \\\\\\\"ARE YOU A WITCH OR NOT?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Oh, right!\\\\\\\" said Hermione, and she whipped out her wand, waved it, muttered something, and sent a jet of the same bluebell flames she had used on Snape at the plant. In a matter of seconds, the two boys felt it loosening its grip as it cringed away from the light and warmth. Wriggling and flailing, it unraveled itself from their bodies, and they were able to pull free.  \\\\\\\"Lucky you pay attention in Herbology, Hermione,\\\\\\\" said Harry as he joined her by the wall, wiping sweat off his face.  \\\\\\\"Yeah,\\\\\\\" said Ron, \\\\\\\"and lucky Harry doesn't lose his head in a crisis -- 'there's no wood,' honestly.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"This way,\\\\\\\" said Harry, pointing down a stone passageway, which was the only way forward.  All they could hear apart from their footsteps was the gentle drip of water trickling down the walls. The passageway sloped downward, and Harry was reminded of Gringotts. With an unpleasant jolt of the heart, he remembered the dragons said to be guarding vaults in the wizards' bank. If they met a dragon, a fully-grown dragon -- Norbert had been bad enough...  \\\\\\\"Can you hear something?\\\\\\\" Ron whispered.  Harry listened. A soft rustling and clinking seemed to be coming from up ahead.  \\\\\\\"Do you think it's a ghost?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"I don't know... sounds like wings to me.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"There's light ahead -- I can see something moving.\\\\\\\"  They reached the end of the passageway and saw before them a brilliantly lit chamber, its ceiling arching high above them. It was full of small, jewel-bright birds, fluttering and tumbling all around the room. On the opposite side of the chamber was a heavy wooden door.  \\\\\\\"Do you think they'll attack us if we cross the room?\\\\\\\" said Ron.  \\\\\\\"Probably,\\\\\\\" said Harry. \\\\\\\"They don't look very vicious, but I suppose if they all swooped down at once... well, there's no other choice... I'll run.\\\\\\\"  He took a deep breath, covered his face with his arms, and sprinted across the room. He expected to feel sharp beaks and claws tearing at him any second, but nothing happened. He reached the door untouched. He pulled the handle, but it was locked.  The other two followed him. They tugged and heaved at the door, but it wouldn't budge, not even when Hermione tried her Alohomora charm.  \\\\\\\"Now what?\\\\\\\" said Ron.  \\\\\\\"These birds... they can't be here just for decoration,\\\\\\\" said Hermione.  They watched the birds soaring overhead, glittering -- glittering?  \\\\\\\"They're not birds!\\\\\\\" Harry said suddenly. \\\\\\\"They're keys! Winged keys -- look carefully. So that must mean...\\\\\\\" he looked around the chamber while the other two squinted up at the flock of keys. \\\\\\\"... yes -- look! Broomsticks! We've got to catch the key to the door!\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"But there are hundreds of them!\\\\\\\"  Ron examined the lock on the door.  \\\\\\\"We're looking for a big, old-fashioned one -- probably silver, like the handle.\\\\\\\"  They each seized a broomstick and kicked off into the air, soaring into the midst of the cloud of keys. They grabbed and snatched, but the bewitched keys darted and dived so quickly it was almost impossible to catch one.  Not for nothing, though, was Harry the youngest Seeker in a century. He had a knack for spotting things other people didn't. After a minute's weaving about through the whirl of rainbow feathers, he noticed a large silver key that had a bent wing, as if it had already been caught and stuffed roughly into the keyhole.  \\\\\\\"That one!\\\\\\\" he called to the others. \\\\\\\"That big one -- there -- no, there -- with bright blue wings -- the feathers are all crumpled on one side.\\\\\\\"  Ron went speeding in the direction that Harry was pointing, crashed into the ceiling, and nearly fell off his broom.  \\\\\\\"We've got to close in on it!\\\\\\\" Harry called, not taking his eyes off the key with the damaged wing. \\\\\\\"Ron, you come at it from above -- Hermione, stay below and stop it from going down and I'll try and catch it. Right, NOW!\\\\\\\"  Ron dived, Hermione rocketed upward, the key dodged them both, and Harry streaked after it; it sped toward the wall, Harry leaned forward and with a nasty, crunching noise, pinned it against the stone with one hand. Ron and Hermione's cheers echoed around the high chamber.  They landed quickly, and Harry ran to the door, the key struggling in his hand. He rammed it into the lock and turned -- it worked. The moment the lock had clicked open, the key took flight again, looking very battered now that it had been caught twice.  \\\\\\\"Ready?\\\\\\\" Harry asked the other two, his hand on the door handle. They nodded. He pulled the door open.  The next chamber was so dark they couldn't see anything at all. But as they stepped into it, light suddenly flooded the room to reveal an astonishing sight.  They were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard, behind the black chessmen, which were all taller than they were and carved from what looked like black stone. Facing them, way across the chamber, were the white pieces. Harry, Ron and Hermione shivered slightly -- the towering white chessmen had no faces.  \\\\\\\"Now what do we do?\\\\\\\" Harry whispered.  \\\\\\\"It's obvious, isn't it?\\\\\\\" said Ron. \\\\\\\"We've got to play our way across the room.\\\\\\\"  Behind the white pieces they could see another door.  \\\\\\\"How?\\\\\\\" said Hermione nervously.  \\\\\\\"I think,\\\\\\\" said Ron, \\\\\\\"we're going to have to be chessmen.\\\\\\\"  He walked up to a black knight and put his hand out to touch the knight's horse. At once, the stone sprang to life. The horse pawed the ground and the knight turned his helmeted head to look down at Ron.  \\\\\\\"Do we -- er -- have to join you to get across?\\\\\\\" The black knight nodded. Ron turned to the other two.  \\\\\\\"This needs thinking about\\the said. I suppose we've got to take the place of three of the black pieces....\\\\\\\"  Harry and Hermione stayed quiet, watching Ron think. Finally he said, \\\\\\\"Now, don't be offended or anything, but neither of you are that good at chess --\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"We're not offended,\\\\\\\" said Harry quickly. \\\\\\\"Just tell us what to do.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Well, Harry, you take the place of that bishop, and Hermione, YOU 90 next to him instead of that castle.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"What about you?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"I'm going to be a knight,\\\\\\\" said Ron.  The chessmen seemed to have been listening, because at these words a knight, a bishop, and a castle turned their backs on the white pieces and walked off the board, leaving three empty squares that Harry, Ron, and Hermione took.  \\\\\\\"White always plays first in chess,\\\\\\\" said Ron, peering across the board. \\\\\\\"Yes... look...\\\\\\\"  A white pawn had moved forward two squares.  Ron started to direct the black pieces. They moved silently wherever he sent them. Harry's knees were trembling. What if they lost?  \\\\\\\"Harry -- move diagonally four squares to the right.\\\\\\\"  Their first real shock came when their other knight was taken. The white queen smashed him to the floor and dragged him off the board, where he lay quite still, facedown.  \\\\\\\"Had to let that happen,\\\\\\\" said Ron, looking shaken. \\\\\\\"Leaves you free to take that bishop, Hermione, go on.\\\\\\\"  Every time one of their men was lost, the white pieces showed no mercy. Soon there was a huddle of limp black players slumped along the wall. Twice, Ron only just noticed in time that Harry and Hermione were in danger. He himself darted around the board, taking almost as many white pieces as they had lost black ones.  \\\\\\\"We're nearly there,\\\\\\\" he muttered suddenly. \\\\\\\"Let me think let me think...\\\\\\\"  The white queen turned her blank face toward him.  \\\\\\\"Yes...\\\\\\\" said Ron softly, \\\\\\\"It's the only way... I've got to be taken.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"NOF Harry and Hermione shouted.  \\\\\\\"That's chess!\\\\\\\" snapped Ron. \\\\\\\"You've got to make some sacrifices! I take one step forward and she'll take me -- that leaves you free to checkmate the king, Harry!\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"But --\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Do you want to stop Snape or not?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Ron --\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Look, if you don't hurry up, he'll already have the Stone!\\\\\\\"  There was no alternative.  \\\\\\\"Ready?\\\\\\\" Ron called, his face pale but determined. \\\\\\\"Here I go - now, don't hang around once you've won.\\\\\\\"  He stepped forward, and the white queen pounced. She struck Ron hard across the head with her stone arm, and he crashed to the floor - Hermione screamed but stayed on her square - the white queen dragged Ron to one side. He looked as if he'd been knocked out.  Shaking, Harry moved three spaces to the left.  The white king took off his crown and threw it at Harry's feet. They had won. The chessmen parted and bowed, leaving the door ahead clear. With one last desperate look back at Ron, Harry and Hermione charged through the door and up the next passageway.  \\\\\\\"What if he's --?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"He'll be all right,\\\\\\\" said Harry, trying to convince himself. \\\\\\\"What do you reckon's next?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"We've had Sprout's, that was the Devil's Snare; Flitwick must've put charms on the keys; McGonagall transfigured the chessmen to make them alive; that leaves Quirrell's spell, and Snape's.\\\\\\\"  They had reached another door.  \\\\\\\"All right?\\\\\\\" Harry whispered.  \\\\\\\"Go on.\\\\\\\"  Harry pushed it open.  A disgusting smell filled their nostrils, making both of them pull their robes up over their noses. Eyes watering, they saw, flat on the floor in front of them, a troll even larger than the one they had tackled, out cold with a bloody lump on its head.  \\\\\\\"I'm glad we didn't have to fight that one,\\\\\\\" Harry whispered as they stepped carefully over one of its massive legs. \\\\\\\"Come on, I can't breathe.\\\\\\\"  He pulled open the next door, both of them hardly daring to look at what came next - but there was nothing very frightening in here, just a table with seven differently shaped bottles standing on it in a line.  \\\\\\\"Snape's,\\\\\\\" said Harry. \\\\\\\"What do we have to do?\\\\\\\"  They stepped over the threshold, and immediately a fire sprang up behind them in the doorway. It wasn't ordinary fire either; it was purple. At the same instant, black flames shot up in the doorway leading onward. They were trapped.  \\\\\\\"Look!\\\\\\\" Hermione seized a roll of paper lying next to the bottles. Harry looked over her shoulder to read it:  Danger lies before you, while safety lies behind,  Two of us will help you, which ever you would find,  One among us seven will let you move ahead,  Another will transport the drinker back instead,  Two among our number hold only nettle wine,  Three of us are killers, waiting bidden in line.  Choose, unless you wish to stay here forevermore,  To help you in your choice, we give you these clues four:  First, however slyly the poison tries to hide  You will always find some on nettle wine's left side;  Second, different are those who stand at either end,  But if you would move onward, neither is your friend;  Third, as you see clearly, all are different size,  Neither dwarf nor giant holds death in their insides;  Fourth, the second left and the second on the right  Are twins once you taste them, though different at first sight.  Hermione let out a great sigh and Harry, amazed, saw that she was smiling, the very last thing he felt like doing.  \\\\\\\"Brilliant,\\\\\\\" said Hermione. \\\\\\\"This isn't magic -- it's logic -- a puzzle. A lot of the greatest wizards haven't got an ounce of logic, they'd be stuck in here forever.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"But so will we, won't we?\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"Of course not,\\\\\\\" said Hermione. \\\\\\\"Everything we need is here on this paper. Seven bottles: three are poison; two are wine; one will get us safely through the black fire, and one will get us back through the purple.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"But how do we know which to drink?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Give me a minute.\\\\\\\"  Hermione read the paper several times. Then she walked up and down the line of bottles, muttering to herself and pointing at them. At last, she clapped her hands.  \\\\\\\"Got it,\\\\\\\" she said. \\\\\\\"The smallest bottle will get us through the black fire -- toward the Stone.\\\\\\\"  Harry looked at the tiny bottle.  \\\\\\\"There's only enough there for one of us,\\\\\\\" he said. \\\\\\\"That's hardly one swallow.\\\\\\\"  They looked at each other.  \\\\\\\"Which one will get you back through the purple flames?\\\\\\\"  Hermione pointed at a rounded bottle at the right end of the line.  \\\\\\\"You drink that,\\\\\\\" said Harry. \\\\\\\"No, listen, get back and get Ron. Grab brooms from the flying- key room, they'll get you out of the trapdoor and past Fluffy -- go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, we need him. I might be able to hold Snape off for a while, but I'm no match for him, really.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"But Harry -- what if You-Know-Who's with him?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Well -- I was lucky once, wasn't I?\\\\\\\" said Harry, pointing at his scar. \\\\\\\"I might get lucky again.\\\\\\\"  Hermione's lip trembled, and she suddenly dashed at Harry and threw her arms around him.  \\\\\\\"Hermione!\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Harry -- you're a great wizard, you know.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"I'm not as good as you,\\\\\\\" said Harry, very embarrassed, as she let go of him.  \\\\\\\"Me!\\\\\\\" said Hermione. \\\\\\\"Books! And cleverness! There are more important things -- friendship and bravery and -- oh Harry -- be careful!\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"You drink first,\\\\\\\" said Harry. \\\\\\\"You are sure which is which, aren't you?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Positive,\\\\\\\" said Hermione. She took a long drink from the round bottle at the end, and shuddered.  \\\\\\\"It's not poison?\\\\\\\" said Harry anxiously.  \\\\\\\"No -- but it's like ice.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Quick, go, before it wears off.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Good luck -- take care.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"GO!\\\\\\\"  Hermione turned and walked straight through the purple fire.  Harry took a deep breath and picked up the smallest bottle. He turned to face the black flames.  \\\\\\\"Here I come,\\\\\\\" he said, and he drained the little bottle in one gulp.  It was indeed as though ice was flooding his body. He put the bottle down and walked forward; he braced himself, saw the black flames licking his body, but couldn't feel them -- for a moment he could see nothing but dark fire -- then he was on the other side, in the last chamber.  There was already someone there -- but it wasn't Snape. It wasn't even Voldemort.  \\\"\",\n          \"still, heart-shaped confetti was falling from the pale blue ceiling. Harry went over to the Gryffindor table, where Ron was sitting looking sickened, and Hermione seemed to have been overcome with giggles.  \\\\What's going on?\\\\\\\" Harry asked them, sitting down and wiping confetti off his bacon.  Ron pointed to the teachers' table, apparently too disgusted to speak. Lockhart, wearing lurid pink robes to match the decorations, was waving for silence. The teachers on either side of him were looking stony-faced. From where he sat, Harry could see a muscle going in Professor McGonagall's cheek. Snape looked as though someone had just fed him a large beaker of Skele-Gro.  \\\\\\\"Happy Valentine's Day!\\\\\\\" Lockhart shouted. \\\\\\\"And may I thank the forty-six people who have so far sent me cards! Yes, I have taken the liberty of arranging this little surprise for you all - and it doesn't end here!\\\\\\\"  Lockhart clapped his hands and through the doors to the entrance hall marched a dozen surly-looking dwarfs. Not just any dwarfs, however. Lockhart had them all wearing golden wings and carrying harps.  \\\\\\\"My friendly, card-carrying cupids!\\\\\\\" beamed Lockhart. \\\\\\\"They will be roving around the school today delivering your valentines! And the fun doesn't stop here! I'm sure my colleagues will want to enter into the spirit of the occasion! Why not ask Professor Snape to show you how to whip up a Love Potion! And while you're at it, Professor Flitwick knows more about Entrancing Enchantments than any wizard I've ever met, the sly old dog!\\\\\\\"  Professor Flitwick buried his face in his hands. Snape was look  * 236  ing as though the first person to ask him for a Love Potion would be force-fed poison.  \\\\\\\"Please, Hermione, tell me you weren't one of the forty-six, 51 said Ron as they left the Great Hall for their first lesson. Hermione suddenly became very interested in searching her bag for her schedule and didn't answer.  All day long, the dwarfs kept barging into their classes to deliver valentines, to the annoyance of the teachers, and late that afternoon as the Gryffindors were walking upstairs for Charms, one of the dwarfs caught up with Harry.  \\\\\\\"Oy, you! 'Arty Potter!\\\\\\\" shouted a particularly grim-looking dwarf, elbowing people out of the way to get to Harry.  Hot all over at the thought of being given a valentine in front of a line of first years, which happened to include Ginny Weasley, Harry tried to escape. The dwarf, however, cut his way through the crowd by kicking people's shins, and reached him before he'd gone two paces.  \\\\\\\"I've got a musical message to deliver to 'Arry Potter in person,\\\\\\\" he said, twanging his harp in a threatening sort of way.  \\\\\\\"Not here,\\\\\\\" Harry hissed, trying to escape.  \\\\\\\"Stay still!\\\\\\\" grunted the dwarf, grabbing hold of Harry's bag and pulling him back.  \\\\\\\"Let me go!\\\\\\\" Harry snarled, tugging.  With a loud ripping noise, his bag split in two. His books, wand, parchment, and quill spilled onto the floor and his ink bottle smashed over everything.  Harry scrambled around, trying to pick it all up before the dwarf started singing, causing something of a holdup in the corridor.  *237*  \\\\\\\"What's going on here?\\\\\\\" came the cold, drawling voice of Draco Malfoy. Harry started stuffing everything feverishly into his ripped bag, desperate to get away before Malfoy could hear his musical valentine.  \\\\\\\"What's all this commotion?\\\\\\\" said another familiar voice as Percy Weasley arrived.  Losing his head, Harry tried to make a run for it, but the dwarf seized him around the knees and brought him crashing to the floor.  \\\\\\\"Right,\\\\\\\" he said, sitting on Harry's ankles. \\\\\\\"Here is your singing valentine:  His eyes are as green as a fresh pickled toad,  His hair is as dark as a blackboard. I wish he was mine, he's really divine, The hero who conquered the Dark Lord  Harry would have given all the gold in Gringotts to evaporate on the spot. Trying valiantly to laugh along with everyone else, he got up, his feet numb from the weight of the dwarf, as Percy Weasley did his best to disperse the crowd, some of whom were crying with mirth.  \\\\\\\"Off you go, off you go, the bell rang five minutes ago, off to class, now,\\\\\\\" he said, shooing some of the younger students away. \\\\\\\"And you, Malfoy-\\\\\\\"  Harry, glancing over, saw Malfoy stoop and snatch up something. Leering, he showed it to Crabbe and Goyle, and Harry realized that he'd got Riddle's diary.  \\\\\\\"Give that back,\\\\\\\" said Harry quietly.  \\\\\\\"Wonder what Potter's written in this?\\\\\\\" said Malfoy, who obvi  * 238  ously hadn't noticed the year on the cover and thought he had Harry's own diary. A hush fell over the onlookers. Ginny was staring from the diary to Harry, looking terrified.  \\\\\\\"Hand it over, Malfoy,\\\\\\\" said Percy sternly.  \\\\\\\"When I've had a look,\\\\\\\" said Malfoy, waving the diary tauntingly at Harry.  Percy said, \\\\\\\"As a school prefect -\\\\\\\" but Harry had lost his temper. He pulled out his wand and shouted, \\\\\\\"Expelliarmus!\\\\\\\" and just as Snape had disarmed Lockhart, so Malfoy found the diary shooting out of his hand into the air. Ron, grinning broadly, caught it.  \\\\\\\"Harry!\\\\\\\" said Percy loudly. \\\\\\\"No magic in the corridors. I'll have to report this, you know!\\\\\\\"  But Harry didn't care, he was one-up on Malfoy, and that was worth five points from Gryffindor any day. Malfoy was looking furious, and as Ginny passed him to enter her classroom, he yelled spitefully after her, \\\\\\\"I don't think Potter liked your valentine much!\\\\\\\"  Ginny covered her face with her hands and ran into class. Snarling, Ron pulled out his wand, too, but Harry pulled him away. Ron didn't need to spend the whole of Charms belching slugs.  It wasn't until they had reached Professor Flitwick's class that Harry noticed something rather odd about Riddle's diary. All his other books were drenched in scarlet ink. The diary, however, was as clean as it had been before the ink bottle had smashed all over it. He tried to point this out to Ron, but Ron was having trouble with his wand again; large purple bubbles were blossoming out of the end, and he wasn't much interested in anything else.  Harry went to bed before anyone else in his dormitory that night. This was partly because he didn't think he could stand Fred and George singing, \\\\\\\"His eyes are as green as a fresh pickled toad\\\\\\\" one more time, and partly because he wanted to examine Riddle's diary again, and knew that Ron thought he was wasting his time.  Harry sat on his four-poster and flicked through the blank pages, not one of which had a trace of scarlet ink on it. Then he pulled a new bottle out of his bedside cabinet, dipped his quill into it, and dropped a blot onto the first page of the diary.  The ink shone brightly on the paper for a second and then, as though it was being sucked into the page, vanished. Excited, Harry loaded up his quill a second time and wrote, \\\\\\\"My name is Harry Potter.\\\\\\\"  The words shone momentarily on the page and they, too, sank without trace. Then, at last, something happened.  Oozing back out of the page, in his very own ink, came words Harry had never written.  \\\\\\\"Hello, Harry Potter. My name is Tom Riddle. How did you come by my diary?\\\\\\\"  These words, too, faded away, but not before Harry had started to scribble back.  \\\\\\\"Someone tried to flush it down a toilet.\\\\\\\"  He waited eagerly for Riddle's reply.  \\\\\\\"Lucky that I recorded my memories in some more lasting way than ink. But I always knew that there would be those who would not want this diary read. \\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"What do you mean?\\\\\\\" Harry scrawled, blotting the page in his excitement.  *240*  `I mean that this diary holds memories of terrible things. Things that were covered up. Things that happened at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. \\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"That's where I am now,\\\\\\\" Harry wrote quickly. \\\\\\\"I'm at Hogwarts, and horrible stuff's been happening. Do you know anything about the Chamber of Secrets?\\\\\\\"  His heart was hammering. Riddle's reply came quickly, his writing becoming untidier, as though he was hurrying to tell all he knew.  \\\\\\\"Of course I know about the Chamber of Secrets. In my day, they told us it was a legend, that it did not exist. But this was a lie. In my fifth year, the Chamber was opened and the monster attacked several students, finally killing one. I caught the person whod opened the Chamber and he was expelled. But the Headmaster, Professor Dippet, ashamed that such a thing had happened at Hogwarts, forbade me to tell the truth. A story was given out that thegirl had died in a freak accident. They gave me a nice, shiny, engraved trophy for my trouble and warned me to keep my mouth shut. But I knew it could happen again. The monster lived on, and the one who had the power to release it was not imprisoned. \\\\\\\"  Harry nearly upset his ink bottle in his hurry to write back.  \\\\\\\"It's happening again now. There have been three attacks and no one seems to know who's behind them. Who was it last time?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"I can show you, if you like, \\\\\\\"came Riddle's reply. \\\\\\\"You don't have  to take my word for it. I can take you inside my memory of the night when I caught him. \\\\\\\"  Harry hesitated, his quill suspended over the diary. What did Riddle mean? How could he be taken inside somebody else's memory? He glanced nervously at the door to the dormitory, which was   *241*  growing dark. When he looked back at the diary, he saw fresh words forming.  \\\\\\\"Let me show you. \\\\\\\"  Harry paused for a fraction of a second and then wrote two letters.  (40K.55  The pages of the diary began to blow as though caught in a high wind, stopping halfway through the month of June. Mouth hanging open, Harry saw that the little square for June thirteenth seemed to have turned into a miniscule television screen. His hands trembling slightly, he raised the book to press his eye against the little window, and before he knew what was happening, he was tilting forward; the window was widening, he felt his body leave his bed, and he was pitched headfirst through the opening in the page, into a whirl of color and shadow.  He felt his feet hit solid ground, and stood, shaking, as the blurred shapes around him came suddenly into focus.  He knew immediately where he was. This circular room with the sleeping portraits was Dumbledore's office - but it wasn't Dumbledore who was sitting behind the desk. A wizened, fraillooking wizard, bald except for a few wisps of white hair, was reading a letter by candlelight. Harry had never seen this man before.  \\\\\\\"I'm sorry,\\\\\\\" he said shakily. \\\\\\\"I didn't mean to butt in -\\\\\\\"  But the wizard didn't look up. He continued to read, frowning slightly. Harry drew nearer to his desk and stammered, \\\\\\\"Er - I'll just go, shall I?\\\\\\\"  Still the wizard ignored him. He didn't seem even to have heard him. Thinking that the wizard might be deaf, Harry raised his voice.  *242*  \\\\\\\"Sorry I disturbed you. I'll go now,\\\\\\\" he half-shouted.  The wizard folded up the letter with a sigh, stood up, walked past Harry without glancing at him, and went to draw the curtains at his window.  The sky outside the window was ruby-red; it seemed to be sunset. The wizard went back to the desk, sat down, and twiddled his thumbs, watching the door.  Harry looked around the office. No Fawkes the phoenix - no whirring silver contraptions. This was Hogwarts as Riddle had known it, meaning that this unknown wizard was Headmaster, not Dumbledore, and he, Harry, was little more than a phantom, completely invisible to the people of fifty years ago.  There was a knock on the office door.  \\\\\\\"Enter,\\\\\\\" said the old wizard in a feeble voice.  A boy of about sixteen entered, taking off his pointed hat. A silver prefect's badge was glinting on his chest. He was much taller than Harry, but he, too, had jet-black hair.  \\\\\\\"Ah, Riddle,\\\\\\\" said the Headmaster.  \\\\\\\"You wanted to see me, Professor Dippet?\\\\\\\" said Riddle. He looked nervous.  \\\\\\\"Sit down,\\\\\\\" said Dippet. \\\\\\\"I've just been reading the letter you sent me.  \\\\\\\"Oh,\\\\\\\" said Riddle. He sat down, gripping his hands together very tightly.  \\\\\\\"My dear boy,\\\\\\\" said Dipper kindly, \\\\\\\"I cannot possibly let you stay at school over the summer. Surely you want to go home for the holidays?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"No,\\\\\\\" said Riddle at once. \\\\\\\"Id much rather stay at Hogwarts than go back to that - to that -\\\\\\\"  * 243*  \\\\\\\"You live in a Muggle orphanage during the holidays, I believe?\\\\\\\" said Dippet curiously.  \\\\\\\"Yes, sir,\\\\\\\" said Riddle, reddening slightly.  \\\\\\\"You are Muggle-born?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Half-blood, sir,\\\\\\\" said Riddle. \\\\\\\"Muggle father, witch mother.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"And are both your parents -?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"My mother died just after I was born, sir. They told me at the orphanage she lived just long enough to name me - Tom after my father, Marvolo after my grandfather.\\\\\\\"  Dipper clucked his tongue sympathetically.  \\\\\\\"The thing is, Tom,\\\\\\\" he sighed, \\\\\\\"Special arrangements might have been made for you, but in the current circumstances . . . .\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"You mean all these attacks, sir?\\\\\\\" said Riddle, and Harry's heart leapt, and he moved closer, scared of missing anything.  \\\\\\\"Precisely,\\\\\\\" said the headmaster. \\\\\\\"My dear boy, you must see how foolish it would be of me to allow you to remain at the castle when term ends. Particularly in light of the recent tragedy ... the death of that poor little girl .... You will be safer by far at your orphanage. As a matter of fact, the Ministry of Magic is even now talking about closing the school. We are no nearer locating the er - source of all this unpleasantness . . . .\\\\\\\"  Riddle's eyes had widened.  \\\\\\\"Sir - if the person was caught - if it all stopped -\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"What do you mean?\\\\\\\" said Dippet with a squeak in his voice, sitting up in his chair. \\\\\\\"Riddle, do you mean you know something about these attacks?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"No, sir,\\\\\\\" said Riddle quickly.  But Harry was sure it was the same sort of \\\\\\\"no\\\\\\\" that he himself had given Dumbledore.  *244*\\\"\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Chapter\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 10,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 38,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 38,\n        \"samples\": [\n          34,\n          37,\n          5\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Book\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 7,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 7,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          2,\n          6\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

        "Interpretation: The polarity score of 0.136 suggests that the text has a slightly positive sentiment, but it's not strongly positive. This means the emotions expressed in the text lean toward the positive side, but the overall tone is fairly neutral with just a mild positive inclination. Range Context: Polarity scores close to 1 would indicate very positive sentiment. Scores close to -1 would indicate strong negative sentiment. A score around 0 would indicate neutral sentiment. In this case, 0.136 shows a moderately positive sentiment, perhaps expressing mild approval or contentment.\n",

        "Interpretation: The subjectivity score of 0.518 indicates that the text is slightly more subjective than objective. This suggests that the text contains a balance between personal opinions, emotions, or beliefs and factual or objective statements, but it leans a little toward subjective (opinion-based) content. Range Context: Scores closer to 1 suggest the text is highly subjective (mainly personal opinions or emotions). Scores closer to 0 suggest the text is highly objective (based on facts or verifiable information). A score of 0.518 suggests that the text likely contains a mix of subjective opinions and factual information but is more on the subjective side. Overall Interpretation: The text analyzed is slightly positive in tone (mild positive sentiment) and contains a balance of opinions and facts, but with a small tilt toward subjectivity.
